## Description

We all lead very busy lives, whether that's with work, or family, or just our own personal lives. Sometimes we need extra help keeping track of our to do lists, appointments, activities, etc. That's why this planner was created. It has time-blocks to show you the current hour and text areas you can type in to write what you need to remember. 

I used bootstrap layouts to style this page. I also used luxon to get the time elements and jquery.
